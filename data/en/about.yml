      content : "Cryptography is my passion because it combines the two fields I like at most: Mathmatics and Computer Science.
                 Cryptography allows us to build primitives so strong, one would think these could never exist like Zero-Knowledge Proofs or Secure Multi-Party-Computation schemes.

      content : The emerging complexity of modern world applications oftenly neglect the users privacy. My goal is to enable research on potentially sensitive data using cryptographic schemes such that the full funcitonality of the application can be achieved while securing the users privacy.
