      content : "Cryptography is my passion as it combines the two fields I like at most: Mathmatics and Computer Science.
                 Cryptography allows us to build primitives so strong, one would think these could never exist like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).
                 Even if these ZKPs are so strong, there are really neat and elegant solutions that use the art of mathematics to achieve security.

      content : "The emerging complexity of modern world applications oftenly neglect the users privacy. 
                 My goal is to enable research on potentially sensitive data using cryptographic schemes such that the full funcitonality 
                 of the application can be achieved while securing the users privacy.
                 An impressive cryptographic construction that achieves this goal is Differential Privacy.
