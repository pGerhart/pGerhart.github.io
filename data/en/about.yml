    content : "Cryptography is my passion because it seamlessly bridges two of my favorite domains: mathematics and computer science.  Marrying mathematical theory's elegance with real-world practicality makes it a fascinating realm where abstract concepts become powerful tools.  While modern cryptographic tools' power and almost enchanting abilities seem like magic because they are too strong to be possibly true, it is fascinating how we can leverage them just through the beauty of assumptions and logical conclusions. It is even more fascinating when your childhood dream career was to be a magician, as it was for me."

    content : "The emerging complexity of modern world applications often neglects users' privacy. 
                 My goal is to enable research on potentially sensitive data using cryptographic schemes such that an application's full functionality 
                 can be achieved while guaranteeing each and every user's privacy.
                 An impressive cryptographic construction that achieves this goal is differential privacy.
