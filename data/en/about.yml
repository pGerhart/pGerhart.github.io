      content : "Cryptography is my passion as it combines the two fields I like at most: Mathmatics and Computer Science.
                 Since Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman turned this this ancient art into a science in 1976,
                 the security of modern cryptographic primitives can be reduced to the hardness of a mathematical problem.
                 While the power and elegance of cryptographic tools seem like magic,

      content : "The emerging complexity of modern world applications oftenly neglect the users privacy. 
                 My goal is to enable research on potentially sensitive data using cryptographic schemes such that the full funcitonality 
                 of the application can be achieved while securing every single users privacy.
                 An impressive cryptographic construction that achieves this goal is Differential Privacy.
