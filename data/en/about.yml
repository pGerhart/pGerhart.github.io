  title :  About Me
  content : "I am Paul Gerhart, a dedicated researcher and assessor, specializing in the field of cryptography. My primary areas of focus encompass the study of fair optimized blockchain protocols, password-hardening, and differential privacy."
  cryptography:
    title : Cryptography 
    icon : ti-lock
    content : "Cryptography is my passion because it seamlessly bridges my two favorite domains: mathematics and computer science.  Marrying mathematical theory's elegance with real-world practicality makes it a fascinating realm where abstract concepts become powerful tools.  While modern cryptographic tools' power and almost enchanting abilities seem like magic because they are too strong to be possibly true, it is fascinating how we can realize them using just the beauty of assumptions and logical conclusions. It is even more fascinating when your desired career was to be a magician as a child, like it was for me."

    content : "The emerging complexity of modern world applications often neglects the users' privacy. 
                 My goal is to enable research on potentially sensitive data using cryptographic schemes such that the full functionality 
                 of the application can be achieved while securing every single user's privacy.
                 An impressive cryptographic construction that achieves this goal is Differential Privacy.
