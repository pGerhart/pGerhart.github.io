        abstract : "Adaptor signatures are a novel cryptographic primitive with numerous applications for conditional payments in blockchain systems, like, payment channels (CCS'20, CCS'21), private coin mixing (CCS'22), and oracle-based payments (NDSS'23). On a high level, this primitive allows the signer to compute pre-signatures on messages for statements of NP relations. Pre-signatures are publicly verifiable that simultaneously hide and commit to a signature of an underlying signature scheme on that message. Anybody possessing a corresponding witness for the statement can adapt the pre-signature to obtain the ``regular'' signature.  Despite their popularity, all known constructions of adaptor signatures are (1) in the random oracle model and are derived from identification schemes via the Fiat-Shamir transform or (2) require modifications to the underlying signature verification algorithm, thus sidestepping a major challenge in the design of adaptor signatures.  This work closes the gap by presenting the first adaptor signature schemes in the standard model based on signature schemes like Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) and Boneh-Boyen-Shacham (BBS+). To achieve this goal, firstly, we develop a new abstraction of a special class of homomorphic signatures called \emph{dichotomic signatures} and show that we can construct adaptor signature schemes generically for such signatures. We show that dichotomic signatures can be instantiated from many well-known signature schemes like identification-based schemes (that use Fiat-Shamir heuristic), CL and BBS+. In the next step, to prove the security of our adaptor signature scheme, we develop a new non-black-box proof technique called transparent reductions that allows us to make a non-black-box use of the code of the reduction in subsequent proofs.  We identify a novel application specific to our CL and BBS+ signature-based schemes in the setting of Anonymous Credentials and blockchain payments. Specifically, using our adaptor constructions, users can atomically pay in a blockchain system to the issuing authority in exchange for the authority's attestations on the users' credentials for access control-based applications.  Our adaptor signature construction, aided by our novel proof technique, adds only a minimal overhead compared to the underlying signature algorithms and is, therefore, highly efficient in practice.

      - title : Practical Schnorr Threshold Signatures without the Algebraic Group Model
        year : 2023
        authors : Hien Chu, Paul Gerhart, Tim Ruffing, Dominique Schröder 
        published : CRYPTO

        abstract : "Threshold signatures are digital signature schemes in which a set of n signers specify a threshold t such that any subset of size t is authorized to produce signatures on behalf of the group.  There has recently been a renewed interest in this primitive, largely driven by the need to secure highly valuable signing keys, e.g., DNSSEC keys or keys protecting digital wallets in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Of special interest are Schnorr threshold signatures currently being standardized by NIST and IETF.  One of the best candidates in this standardization process is FROST, widely used in practice and whose security was recently analyzed at CRYPTO'22.  We follow this research line focusing on FROST's unforgeability combined with a practical distributed key generation algorithm.  Existing proofs of this setup either use non-standard heuristics or idealized group models like the AGM or idealized key generation.  Moreover, most existing works do not consider all relevant optimizations that have been proposed FROST3, which are crucial for practice. We close this gap between theory and practice by presenting the Schnorr threshold signature scheme OLAF, which is an extension of FROST3, and prove its unforgeability when used with a variant of Pedersen's Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol (as commonly used for FROST).  Our proof is relative to the OMDL assumption and relies, like regular Schnorr signatures, on the random oracle model.  This proof based on standard heuristics can now be used to standardize the optimized FROST with a practical relevant DKG.  As a technical result of independent interest, we introduce the proof technique of ``serial forking'' that allows doing this proof in the random oracle model by different variants of forking sequentially."

        abstract : "In this thesis we aim to prove that every 3-manifold M arises from a surgery on a link on  S3. In order to do that, we show the existence of a so-called Heegaard-Splitting of M and S3 of the same genus.  Now to fit the both Splittings into each other, it is required to move certain links, so-called characteristic curves, on the surfaces into each other.  To achieve this, we have to cut out solid tori and thus get a homeomorphic copy S3 without the interiors of the tori of M without another set of Tori.  Now if we glue them back in the right way, which we can regard as a Dehn surgery, we obtain a homeomorphism between M and S3."
