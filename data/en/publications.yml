        abstract : "Adaptor signatures extend the functionality of regular signatures through the computation of *pre-signatures* on messages for statements of NP relations. Pre-signatures are publicly verifiable; they simultaneously hide and commit to a signature of an underlying signature scheme on that message. Anybody possessing a corresponding witness for the statement can adapt the pre-signature to obtain the „regular“ signature. Adaptor signatures have found numerous applications for conditional payments in blockchain systems, like payment channels~(CCS'20, CCS'21), private coin mixing (CCS'22, SP'23), and oracle-based payments (NDSS'23).  In our work, we revisit the state of the security of adaptor signatures and their constructions. In particular, our two main contributions are:  \n\n - **Security Gaps and Definitions:** We review the widely-used security model of adaptor signatures due to Aumayr et al. (ASIACRYPT'21), and identify gaps in their definitions that render known protocols for private coin-mixing and oracle-based payments *insecure*. We give simple counterexamples of adaptor signatures that are secure w.r.t.\ their definitions, but result in insecure instantiations of these protocols. To fill these gaps, we identify a minimal set of modular definitions that align with these practical applications.  \n\n - **Secure Constructions:** Despite their popularity, *all* known constructions are (1) derived from identification schemes via the Fiat-Shamir transform in the random oracle model or (2) require modifications to the underlying signature verification algorithm, thus making the construction useless in the setting of cryptocurrencies. More concerningly, *all* known constructions were proven secure w.r.t. the insufficient definitions of Aumayr et al., leaving us with no provably-secure adaptor signature scheme to use in applications.   \n\n We salvage *all* current applications by proving security of the widely-used Schnorr adaptor signatures under our proposed definitions. We also provide several new constructions including presenting the *first* adaptor signature schemes for Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL), Boneh-Boyen-Shacham (BBS+), and Waters signatures; all of which are proven secure *in the standard model*. Our new constructions rely on a new abstraction of digital signatures, called *dichotomic signatures*, which covers the essential properties we need to build adaptor signatures. Proving security of all constructions (including identification-based schemes) relies on a *novel non-black-box* proof technique which is of independent interest."

      - title : Practical Schnorr Threshold Signatures without the Algebraic Group Model

        abstract : "Threshold signatures are digital signature schemes in which a set of n signers specify a threshold t such that any subset of size t is authorized to produce signatures on behalf of the group.  There has recently been a renewed interest in this primitive, largely driven by the need to secure highly valuable signing keys, e.g., DNSSEC keys or keys protecting digital wallets in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Of special interest are Schnorr threshold signatures currently being standardized by NIST and IETF.  One of the best candidates in this standardization process is FROST, widely used in practice and whose security was recently analyzed at CRYPTO'22.  We follow this research line focusing on FROST's unforgeability combined with a practical distributed key generation algorithm.  Existing proofs of this setup either use non-standard heuristics or idealized group models like the AGM or idealized key generation.  Moreover, most existing works do not consider all relevant optimizations that have been proposed FROST3, which are crucial for practice. We close this gap between theory and practice by presenting the Schnorr threshold signature scheme OLAF, which is an extension of FROST3, and prove its unforgeability when used with a variant of Pedersen's Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol (as commonly used for FROST).  Our proof is relative to the OMDL assumption and relies, like regular Schnorr signatures, on the random oracle model.  This proof based on standard heuristics can now be used to standardize the optimized FROST with a practical relevant DKG.  As a technical result of independent interest, we introduce the proof technique of ``serial forking'' that allows doing this proof in the random oracle model by different variants of forking sequentially."

        abstract : "In this thesis we aim to prove that every 3-manifold M arises from a surgery on a link on  S3. In order to do that, we show the existence of a so-called Heegaard-Splitting of M and S3 of the same genus.  Now to fit the both Splittings into each other, it is required to move certain links, so-called characteristic curves, on the surfaces into each other.  To achieve this, we have to cut out solid tori and thus get a homeomorphic copy S3 without the interiors of the tori of M without another set of Tori.  Now if we glue them back in the right way, which we can regard as a Dehn surgery, we obtain a homeomorphism between M and S3."
